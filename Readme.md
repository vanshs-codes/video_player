## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Secure Authentication & Authorization**:
    * **JWT-based Authentication**: Implements a secure authentication system using short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens, enhancing security by minimizing the exposure of access tokens.
    * **Password Hashing**: Uses `bcrypt` to hash user passwords before storing them, protecting user credentials against database breaches.
    * **Protected Routes**: Middleware ensures that sensitive operations (like updating or deleting content) can only be performed by authenticated and authorized users.

* **Complete User & Channel Management**:
    * Full user lifecycle management: register, login, logout.
    * Users can update their personal details, password, and profile images (avatar and cover image).
    * Public-facing channel pages to display user-specific content.
    * Functionality to track and retrieve a user's personal watch history.

* **Full-Fledged Video Content Management**:
    * Complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for video content.
    * Users have full control over the publishing status of their videos, allowing for private/unlisted content.

* **Cloud Media Management**:
    * Seamless integration with **Cloudinary** for robust video and image hosting, processing, and delivery via its global CDN.
    * Automated cleanup of old assets from the cloud when they are updated or deleted, preventing orphaned files and managing storage costs.

* **Advanced Data Aggregation & Filtering**:
    * Powerful **MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines** for dynamic data retrieval.
    * Features include text-based search, server-side pagination for handling large datasets, and dynamic sorting.

This project is built using the MERN stack, with a focus on creating a scalable and maintainable backend architecture.

| Category          | Technology                                                                                                  | Why it was chosen                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Runtime** | **Node.js** | Provides a fast, scalable, and event-driven environment perfect for building real-time and data-intensive backend services.                      |
| **Framework** | **Express.js** | A minimal and flexible framework that provides a robust set of features for web applications, simplifying routing and middleware management. |
| **Database** | **MongoDB (with MongoDB Atlas)** | A NoSQL database chosen for its flexible schema design, which is ideal for handling complex, nested data like user profiles and video metadata.   |
| **ODM** | **Mongoose** | An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data, enforce validation, and encapsulate business logic using custom methods and middleware (`pre` hooks).      |
| **Authentication**| **JSON Web Tokens (JWT) & bcrypt** | JWT for creating secure, stateless authentication tokens (access and refresh). `bcrypt` for industry-standard password hashing.          |
| **File Handling** | **Cloudinary & Multer** | **Multer** for handling incoming `multipart/form-data` efficiently. **Cloudinary** for offloading media storage, providing powerful transformations, and fast delivery via its CDN. |

## üîÆ Future Improvements

* **Implement a Subscription Model**: Allow users to subscribe to channels and get a personalized feed.
* **Add Likes and Comments**: Introduce social features for user engagement on videos.
* **Create Playlists**: Enable users to organize videos into personal or public playlists.
* **Optimize Search**: Transition from `$regex` to MongoDB's more efficient `$text` search with a dedicated text index for better performance on large datasets.
* **Implement Caching**: Use a caching layer like Redis to cache frequently accessed data (e.g., popular videos, user profiles) to reduce database load and improve response times.
